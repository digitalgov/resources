_This repository tries to assemble lists of useful digital resources for government.  Feel free to offer suggestions by [filing pull requests](https://github.com/digitalgov/resources/edit/master/README.md) or [filing issues](https://github.com/digitalgov/resources/issues).  There are many ways these lists could be represented but we wanted to get started with one.  If you'd like to suggest another method, feel free to file an issue._
